CSCI 220 was a JavaScript based introductory class where I expanded knowledge of basic and linear data types
as well as introductions to libraries, databases, JSON, and classes/objects

CSCI 221 was a C++ based course that retreaded similar ground but also had discussions on Object Oriented Progamming, search and sort alogorithms, and input/output streams
Many of the labs took place in an online textbook that I have unfortunately since lost access to 

CSCI 301 is my current course where we will discuss and create projects related to recursion and recurrence, trees, binary
trees, 2/3 trees, directed and undirected graphs, searching and sorting, and program layering
We are also learning proper code commenting, program documentation, and user documentation
