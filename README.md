#School Projects Portfolio
This repository contains all of the school projects I have completed as part of my Computer Science Coursework with links to most relevant projects
They demonstrate growth in programming fundamentals, Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms using *JavaScript* and C++

#Courses and Projects

###CSCI 200 - Introduction to Programming
Refined foundational programming data types and began experience with Databases, JSON, Libraries, and OOP

Assigmnents:

[JSON Data Transformation](/CSCI200/JSON_Data_Transformation) - Validates and transforms user input into JSON for storage

[TicTacToe Assignment](/CSCI200/TicTacToe_Assignment) - Designed and implemented a TicTacToe game for one or two players while managing game state,
AI Logic, and DOM manipulation

###CSCI 201 - Computer Science 1 
Further refinement of Computer Science fundamentals and introductions to pointers, linked lists, search and sort algorithms, I/O streams and Object Oriented Programming with C++
*Note many of the labs for this class were done through an online textbook that I have since lost access to

[Employee Class Assignment](/CSCI201/Employee_Class_Assignment) - Showed understanding of fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction

[File Head Assignment](/CSCI201/File_Head_Assignment) - Created a program that demonstrates knowledge of fundamental concepts of I/O streams

###CSCI 301 - In progress course where I will use C++ to develop and enhance skills around ADTS, trees, graphs, searching and sorting, and program layering

[Fraction Class Assignment](/CSCI301/Fraction_Class_Assignment) - Shows a stronger knowledge of OOP concepts of encapsulation and overloading for fractions

[E-Commerce Assignment](/CSCI301/E-Commerce_Assignment) - Program built using OOP concepts of encapsulation, overloading and inheritance to create a simple
virtual shopping cart that users can add, remove, and modify items from
