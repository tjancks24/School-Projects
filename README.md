###CSCI 200 - Introduction to Programming
Refined foudational programming data types and began expirience with Databases, JSON, Libraries, and OOP

Assigmnents:

[JSON Data Transformation](/CSCI220/JSON_Data_Transformation) - Validates and transforms user input into JSON for storage

[LODASH Assignment](/CSCI220/LODASH_Assignment) - Built an interactive dashboard that parses Student data and allows users to identify students
in catagories such as Attendance, Major, and Year

[Movie Database Assignment](/CSCI220/Movie_Database_Asignment) - 

[TicTacToe Assignment](/CSCI220/TicTacToe_Assignment)

###CSCI 201 was a C++ based course that retreaded similar ground but also had discussions on Object-Oriented Progamming, search and sort alogorithms, and input/output streams
Many of the labs took place in an online textbook that I have unfortunately since lost access to 

[C++ Foundations](/CSCI221/C++_Foundations)

[Employee Class Assignment](/CSCI221/Employee_Class_Assigment)

[File Head Assignment](/CSCI221/File_Head_Assignment)

[Hotel Assignment](/CSCI221/Hotel_Assignment)

[Payroll Assignment](/CSCI221/Payroll_Assignment)

CSCI 301 is my current, C++ based, course where we will continue using Object-Oriented Programming and discuss and create projects related to recursion and recurrence, trees, binary
trees, 2/3 trees, directed and undirected graphs, searching and sorting, and program layering
We are also learning proper code commenting, program documentation, and user documentation
