# School-Projects
Collection of my school projects

CSCI 220 was a JavaScript based introductory class where I expanded knowledge of basic and linear data types
as well as introductions to libraries, databases, JSON, and classes/objects

2D Arrays: [/workspaces/School-Projects/CSCI 220/2DArrayslab/2DAExplnation.md](url)

CSCI 221 was a C++ based course that retreaded similar ground but also had discussions on Object Oriented Progamming, search efficiency, sort efficiency, and input/output streams

CSCI 301 is my current course where we will discuss and create projects related to recursion and recurrence, trees, binary
trees, 2/3 trees, directed and undirected graphs, searching and sorting, and program layering
We are also learning proper code commenting, program documentation, and user documentation
